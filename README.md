## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🖥️ Frontend (Vite + React.js)
1. Open terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd invoice-generator-client
   ```
2. Navigate to the React client folder:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Add environment variables:
   Create a .env file inside the invoice-generator-client directory
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
4. Add the following keys inside .env:
   ```bash
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_*************
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. The Vite React app will start at:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
   
> 🏗️ The backend API was bootstrapped using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/), 
> with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB, and Lombok.

### Setup Backend (Spring Boot + MongoDB)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../invoicegeneratorapi
   ```
2. Configure MongoDB Connection (Compass - Local)
- Make sure your MongoDB Compass server is running locally.
- In src/main/resources/application.properties, add your MongoDB URI:
  ```bash
  spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/invoiceDB
  ```
- This connects Spring Boot to your local MongoDB Compass database.
  
3. Run the Spring Boot Server
- If using Maven:
  ```bash
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- Or open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run InvoicegeneratorapiApplication.java
  
4. The backend will start at:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
